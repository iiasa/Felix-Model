The model is developed on the modelling software Vensim, therefore the users should have Vensim installed to be able to display and simulate the model. This version of the FeliX model requires features that are available only in the licensed version, which is Vensim DSS. The users who have no access to Vensim DSS can still display the model by using the Vensim Model Reader.
