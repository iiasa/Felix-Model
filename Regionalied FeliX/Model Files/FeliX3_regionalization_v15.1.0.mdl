	~	to obtain the real earnings per capita of each group instead of relative incomes by \
		model calibration.
		Two assumptions: (1) the relationship between income and age tends to \
		exhibit an inverted-U-shape pattern. Incomes rise with age and then drop \
		slightly as taxpayers enter retirement. (2)  Male has more incomes than \
		female in the same age group.
