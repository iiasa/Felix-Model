The current version of FeliX includes the following main extensions:

- an aggregate wellbeing measure, Years of Good Life
- age- and gender-dependent poverty rates
- age- and gender-dependent life expectancy and healthy life expectancy
- climate impacts on economic output (GDP) and human mortality

These updates are documented in [Eker et al.(2023)](https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/18984/). This version is used in Chapter 5 of the [IIASA Flagship Report](https://iiasa.ac.at/sites/default/files/2023-09/IIASA%20Flagship%20Report.pdf) and Eker et al. (*under review*) *Wellbeing Cost of Carbon*. 

The model reads inputs from the excel files you see in this folder, hence they must be placed in the same directory as the model file.
