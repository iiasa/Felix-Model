The Full of Economic-Environment Linkages and Integration dX/dt (FeliX) is a global system dynamics model of climate, economy, environment and society interactions, developed at International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), first within the GEO-BENE project.

There is an online document for the global FeliX model, https://iiasa.github.io/felix_docs/. The underlying modeling methodology and information to the FeliX resources and publications are well introduced in the online document.
